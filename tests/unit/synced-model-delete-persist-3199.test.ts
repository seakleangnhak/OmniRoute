/**
 * #3199 follow-up to #3204 — a deleted synced (fetched) model must STAY deleted
 * across an auto-fetch re-import.
 *
 * #3204 added `removeSyncedAvailableModel`, but the DELETE route did not mark the
 * model hidden and `replaceSyncedAvailableModelsForConnection` did not skip hidden
 * ids — so the next `/models` sync re-imported the model and it reappeared. This
 * test guards that a hidden id is filtered out on re-import.
